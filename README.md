A C++ project which creates a captcha that asks the user to draw a given digit. Here is a simple graphical interface that gives a digit and a field for drawing. The neural network was trained on the MNIST digits dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/code/ngbolin/mnist-dataset-digit-recognizer).
The model performance was tested on Kaggle (by uploading predicted results for the test set from Kaggle. I got 0.8735 accuracy on the digit recognition problem.
This project uses my libraries, which can be found in my other repositories: MatrixOperationsCpp, AData, and LysaNets.
Below is a user interface that appears when we launch the program.
